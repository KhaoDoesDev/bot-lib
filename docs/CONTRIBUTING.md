# Contributing

bot-lib is a monorepo with all multiple packages such as `protocol`, `item`, `biome`, `registry`, etc. It is important that you follow the file structure of the monorepo.
We appreciate any contributions to the project but if you have any questions feel free to ask in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/TbenYwXsnT).

From what it may seem, we aren't competing with other libraries like [mineflayer](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer) or [azalea](https://github.com/azalea-rs/azalea), I think they are great projects and this project wouldn't exist without them. However, the reason this project exists is because I want to learn more about the Minecraft protocol and wanted to create a library that would be easy to use and understand internally and externally.
